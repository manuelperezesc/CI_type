# CI_type
Determination of type of CI from Gaussian output


The python code, which only imports the module math, prints the results in terms of the angle between all the components of the gradients for both both species involved in the conical intersection. The range to consider it peaked (180 degrees) is introduced in the code, as well as the name (and route) of the file.
